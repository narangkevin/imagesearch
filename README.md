# imagesearch
This project is built to search for any type of image in your computer.

Steps:
  1. Provide a location of your folder where you want to search for images (File Chooser will help you with that)
  2. After that just type in the string of the image (name of the file).
  3. Note that the name can be just partly for eg: File name - himalaya.jpg
      if you search by typing just 'him' it will give you results for every image file with the name that contains this
      sequence.
  4. Images will be displayed as a form of thumbnail.
